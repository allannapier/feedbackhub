## Technical Debt & Issues

1. **Authentication Session**: The authentication session doesn't seem to persist properly after email verification
2. **Missing Routes**: Several dashboard routes return 404 (e.g., `/dashboard/forms`)
3. **API Implementation**: API endpoints exist but need full implementation
4. **Error Handling**: Needs comprehensive error handling across the application
5. **Loading States**: UI components need proper loading states

## Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Fix Authentication Flow**
   - Debug session persistence issue
   - Ensure proper redirect after login
   - Test with the Gmail test account

2. **Complete Form Builder**
   - Implement form creation UI
   - Connect to API endpoints
   - Add form types (rating, text, NPS, etc.)
   - Create form preview

3. **Public Feedback Collection**
   - Create public form view by slug
   - Implement response submission
   - Add thank you page
   - Test feedback flow

4. **Dashboard Features**
   - Fix routing for dashboard pages
   - Implement form list view
   - Add response viewer
   - Create basic analytics charts

5. **Social Sharing MVP**
   - Set up Vercel OG for image generation
   - Create testimonial card templates
   - Implement share functionality
   - Add social platform integration

## Resource Requirements

- **Development Time**: ~10 weeks remaining to complete all phases
- **Integrations Needed**: 
  - Resend (email) - for feedback requests
  - Stripe (payments) - for paid tiers
  - Vercel OG (images) - for testimonial cards
  - Twitter/LinkedIn APIs - for social sharing
  
## Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: Social platform API changes could affect sharing features
- **Medium Risk**: Authentication issues could delay user testing
- **Low Risk**: UI/UX iterations based on user feedback

## Recommendations

1. Focus on completing Phase 1 MVP features before moving to Phase 2
2. Prioritize fixing the authentication flow for proper testing
3. Implement core feedback collection before social features
4. Consider simplified MVP scope to launch sooner
5. Add comprehensive error logging early

## Metrics to Track

- User registration/activation rate
- Forms created per user
- Feedback responses collected
- Social shares generated
- Conversion to paid plans
